-----------------------
* Rename the Git repository from docker-pupil to container-pupil (see the
  following item about Podman).
* Use Podman instead of Docker (it still uses the same Dockerfile).
  Podman is more modern, has better performances, and is easier to install (no
  additional daemon is needed).
* Base the container on Ubuntu, to just install the *.deb package provided by
  the upstream developers.
* Versions: Ubuntu 18.04 and Pupil 1.9.
