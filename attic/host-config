Host configuration
==================

*Update*: it seems that the Pupil Capture application works fine even if the
host OS is not configured with the fix explained below. So I think we can now
ignore the information in this file.

The host OS needs some configuration.

The provided webcams with the Pupil hardware don't work well with the Linux
kernel, there are some warnings and errors in the 'dmesg' command output after
plugging in the USB cables. It's apparently a problem with the sound subsystem
(the webcam has also sound support, even if it is not used by the Pupil
software).

Tested with Fedora 22, Linux kernel 4.3.5.

Fixing the problem
------------------

# echo "blacklist snd-usb-audio" > /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
[ reboot ]

It disables audio support for any USB device. After that, there is no more
warnings or errors in the dmesg output (just after plugging in the USB webcams,
at least).
